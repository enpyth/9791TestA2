1. miss info

kit 3/9

2. repeat content

repeat config and input data

3. Hallucinations

redundant and useless attributes in data entity like 'weight' and 'price' in Kits.

4. parameter name inconsistency

The parameter names in the entity class do not match those in the configuration file, which may lead to misunderstanding.

5. Interface-Configuration Mismatch

When I report bugs in parameter inconsistency, the AI only fix configuration but the interface has not been fixd which leads to program running error.

6. configuration module interface inconsistency

I report same bugs in prompt 7 and prompt 13 to deal with a problem that the entity should be load by configurations. But I get 2 style interface of loading configuration.

The engine, tyres and aerokit use customized method in RacingSimulation, and track use a standard config read method.

```
public class RacingSimulation {
    private static final ConfigurationManager configManager = ConfigurationManager.getInstance();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a race car with components from configuration
        Engine engine = createEngineFromConfig("Turbo V6");
        Tyre tyres = createTyreFromConfig("Soft Compound");
        AerodynamicKit aeroKit = createAeroKitFromConfig("Standard Kit");

        RaceCar raceCar = new RaceCar("Speed Demon", engine, tyres, aeroKit);

        // Load track from configuration
        Track track = configManager.loadTrack("Technical Park");
...
```

7. Expired file

In prompt 13, AI update interface about how to create a track. But a new configuration file 'track.json' was created, which is almost same as 'track-config.json'.

Then in prompt 14, I report the issue but AI give no response to me.

Finally, the two repeat track configuration 'tracks.json and 'track-config.json' exist in the project.

In fact, the expired 'track-config.json' should be deleted, and 'tracks.json' should have same named style of other configuration files.
