I strongly do not recommend using AI for coding work. The 95% code in this project was generated by claude-3.7 in Cursor. I meet with a lot of bugs although I used best product of AI programming, 

0. Feature Bugs

    The error cannot be fixed. I try many times to provide logs and error information ask AI fix the logic error of incorrect fuel capacity and strategy calculation, but it don't work.

1. Miss Information

    Sometimes AI can not get all information especially your prompt is long content. For example, in prompt 1, I give AI all kits infomation but it create 3/9 kits.

2. Hallucinations

    AI frequently generate redundant and useless attributes. For example, the attributes like 'weight' and 'price' in data entity of all components are not required in my prompt but AI created it.

3. Parameter Name Inconsistency

    The parameter names in the entity class do not match those in the configuration file, which may lead to misunderstanding.

4. Interface-Configuration Mismatch

    When I report bugs in parameter inconsistency, the AI only fix configuration but the interface has not been fixd which leads to program running error.

5. Configuration Module Interface Inconsistency

    I report same bugs in prompt 7 and prompt 13 to deal with a problem that the entity should be load by configurations. But I get 2 style interface of loading configuration.

    The engine, tyres and aerokit use customized method in RacingSimulation, and track use a standard config read method.

    The problem reduced code quality and readability.
    ```
    public class RacingSimulation {
        private static final ConfigurationManager configManager = ConfigurationManager.getInstance();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create a race car with components from configuration
            Engine engine = createEngineFromConfig("Turbo V6");
            Tyre tyres = createTyreFromConfig("Soft Compound");
            AerodynamicKit aeroKit = createAeroKitFromConfig("Standard Kit");

            RaceCar raceCar = new RaceCar("Speed Demon", engine, tyres, aeroKit);

            // Load track from configuration
            Track track = configManager.loadTrack("Technical Park");
    ...
    ```

6. Iteration Requirements

    AI cannot manage iteration requirements. The expired code and file cannot be properly processed.
    
    For example. In prompt 13, AI update interface about how to create a track. But a new configuration file 'track.json' was created, which is almost same as 'track-config.json'. Then in prompt 14, I report the issue but AI give no response to me. Finally, the two repeat track configuration 'tracks.json and 'track-config.json' exist in the project. In fact, the expired 'track-config.json' should be deleted, and 'tracks.json' should have same named style of other configuration files.
