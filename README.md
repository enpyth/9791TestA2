# Race Strategy Optimiser and Car Customisation Tool

## Overview
This Java-based application simulates a race team management system, allowing users to customize race cars and optimize race strategies. The system provides detailed car customization options and sophisticated race strategy planning based on various track conditions and car configurations.

## Features

### Car Customisation
- **Engine Selection**: Choose from various engine types (standard, turbocharged, etc.)
- **Tyre Management**: Select from different tyre compounds (soft, medium, hard)
- **Aerodynamic Kits**: 9 different aerodynamic configurations available:
  - Standard Kit
  - Downforce-Focused Kit
  - Low-Drag Kit
  - Adjustable Aero Kit
  - Ground Effect Kit
  - Drag Reduction System (DRS) Kit
  - Wet Weather Kit
  - Hybrid Kit
  - Extreme Aero Kit

### Race Strategy Optimisation
- Track-specific strategy planning
- Weather condition consideration
- Fuel consumption optimization
- Tyre wear management
- Pit stop timing calculations

## Technical Specifications

### Aerodynamic Kit Performance Metrics
Each aerodynamic kit affects the following performance parameters:
- Drag Coefficient (Cd)
- Downforce (kg)
- Top Speed (km/h)
- Fuel Efficiency (km/l)
- Cornering Ability (rating out of 10)

### Track Types
The system supports various track types including:
- High-speed circuits
- Technical circuits
- Mixed circuits
- Wet weather conditions
